# AppStream 2\.0 Agent Version History<a name="agent-software-versions"></a>

The Amazon AppStream 2\.0 agent software runs on your streaming instances, enabling end users to connect to and start their streaming applications\. Starting December 7, 2017, your streaming instances can be automatically updated with the latest features, performance improvements, and security updates that are available from AWS\. Before December 7, 2017, agent updates were included with new base image releases\. 

To use the latest AppStream 2\.0 agent software, you need to rebuild your images by using new base images published by AWS on or after December 7, 2017\. When you do this, the option to enable automatic updates of the agent is selected by default in the Image Assistant\. We recommend that you leave this option selected so that any new image builder or fleet instance that is launched from your image always uses the latest version of the agent\. For more information, see [Tutorial: Create a Custom AppStream 2\.0 Image](tutorial-image-builder.md)\.

The following table describes the latest updates that are available in released versions of the AppStream 2\.0 agent\.
