# Enable Users to Share a USB Device with an AppStream 2\.0 Streaming Session<a name="share-usb-devices-with-session"></a>

Before users share their USB devices with an AppStream 2\.0 session, the USB devices must be qualified\. Otherwise, when users start a streaming session, their USB device is not detected by AppStream 2\.0 and cannot be shared with the session\.
