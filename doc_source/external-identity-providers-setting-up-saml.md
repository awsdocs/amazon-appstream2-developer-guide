# Setting Up SAML<a name="external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml"></a>

To enable users to sign in to AppStream 2\.0 by using their existing credentials, and start streaming applications, you can set up identity federation using SAML 2\.0\. To do this, use an IAM role and a relay state URL to configure your SAML 2\.0\-compliant identity provider \(IdP\) and enable AWS to permit your federated users to access an AppStream 2\.0 stack\. The IAM role grants users the permissions to access the stack\. The relay state is the stack portal to which users are forwarded after successful authentication by AWS\.

## Prerequisites<a name="external-identity-providers-setting-up-prerequisites"></a>

Complete the following prerequisites before configuring your SAML 2\.0 connection\.

1. Configure your SAML\-based IdP to establish a trust relationship with AWS\. 
   + Inside your organization's network, configure your identity store to work with a SAML\-based IdP\. For configuration resources, see [AppStream 2\.0 Integration with SAML 2\.0](external-identity-providers-further-info.md)\.
   + Use your SAML\-based IdP to generate and download a federation metadata document that describes your organization as an IdP\. This signed XML document is used to establish the relying party trust\. Save this file to a location that you can access from the IAM console later\.

1. Use the AppStream 2\.0 management console to create an AppStream 2\.0 stack\. You need the stack name to create the IAM policy and to configure your IdP integration with AppStream 2\.0, as described later in this topic\.

   You can create an AppStream 2\.0 stack by using the AppStream 2\.0 management console, AWS CLI, or AppStream 2\.0 API\. For more information, see [Create an AppStream 2\.0 Fleet and Stack](set-up-stacks-fleets.md)\.

## Step 1: Create a SAML Identity Provider in AWS IAM<a name="external-identity-providers-create-saml-provider"></a>

First, create a SAML IdP in AWS IAM\. This IdP defines your organization's IdP\-to\-AWS trust relationship using the metadata document generated by the IdP software in your organization\. For more information, see [Creating and Managing a SAML Identity Provider \(AWS Management Console\) ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml.html#idp-manage-identityprovider-console) in the *IAM User Guide*\. For information about working with SAML IdPs in AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\), see [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-iam.html) in the *AWS GovCloud \(US\) User Guide*\.

## Step 2: Create a SAML 2\.0 Federation IAM Role<a name="external-identity-providers-grantperms"></a>

Next, create a SAML 2\.0 federation IAM role\. This step establishes a trust relationship between IAM and your organization's IdP, which identifies your IdP as a trusted entity for federation\. 

**To create an IAM role for the SAML IdP**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**, **Create role**\. 

1. For **Role type**, choose **SAML 2\.0 federation**\. 

1. For **SAML Provider**, select the SAML IdP that you created\. 
**Important**  
Do not choose either of the two SAML 2\.0 access methods \(**Allow programmatic access only** or **Allow programmatic and AWS Management Console access**\)\.

1. For **Attribute**, choose **SAML:sub\_type**\. 

1. For **Value**, type **persistent**\. This step restricts role access to only SAML user streaming requests that include a SAML subject type assertion with a value of persistent\. If the SAML:sub\_type is persistent, your IdP sends the same unique value for the NameID element in all SAML requests from a particular user\. For more information about the SAML:sub\_type assertion, see the *Uniquely Identifying Users in SAML\-Based Federation* section in [Using SAML\-Based Federation for API Access to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html#CreatingSAML-configuring)\.

1. Review your SAML 2\.0 trust information, confirming the correct trusted entity and condition, and then choose **Next: Permissions**\. 

1. On the **Attach permissions policies** page, choose **Next: Tags**\.

1. \(Optional\) Type a key and value for each tag that you want to add\. For more information, see [Tagging IAM Users and Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html)\. 

1. When you're done, choose **Next: Review**\. You create and embed an inline policy for this role later\.

1. For **Role name**, type a name that helps you identify the purpose of this role\. Because various entities might reference the role, you cannot edit the name of the role after it has been created\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Role description**, type a description for the new role\.

1. Review the role details and choose **Create role**\.

## Step 3: Embed an Inline Policy for the IAM Role<a name="external-identity-providers-embed-inline-policy-for-IAM-role"></a>

Next, embed an inline IAM policy for the role that you created\. When you embed an inline policy, the permissions in the policy cannot be inadvertently attached to the wrong principal entity\. The inline policy provides federated users with access to the AppStream 2\.0 stack that you created\.

1. In the details for the IAM role that you created, choose the **Permissions** tab, and then choose **Add inline policy**\. The Create policy wizard starts\.

1. In **Create policy**, choose the **JSON** tab\.

1. Copy and paste the following JSON policy into the JSON window and modify the resource by entering your AWS Region Code, account ID, and stack name\. In the following policy, `"Action": "appstream:Stream"` is the action that provides your AppStream 2\.0 users with permissions to connect to streaming sessions on the stack that you created\. 

   ```
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "appstream:Stream",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:appstream:REGION-CODE:ACCOUNT-ID-WITHOUT-HYPHENS:stack/STACK-NAME",
         "Condition": {
             "StringEquals": {
                 "appstream:userId": "${saml:sub}"           
             }
           }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Choose a value for *REGION\-CODE* that corresponds to the AWS Region where your AppStream 2\.0 stack exists\. Replace *STACK\-NAME* with the name of the stack\. Note that this value is case\-sensitive, so the case in the stack name that you specify in this policy must match the case in the AppStream 2\.0 stack name as it appears in the **Stacks** dashboard of the AppStream 2\.0 management console\. 

   For resources in AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\), use the following format for the ARN: 

   `arn:aws-us-gov:appstream:`*REGION\-CODE*`:`*ACCOUNT\-ID\-WITHOUT\-HYPHENS*`:stack/`*STACK\-NAME*

1. When you're done, choose **Review policy**\. The [Policy Validator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html) reports any syntax errors\. 

## Step 4: Configure Your SAML\-Based IdP<a name="external-identity-providers-config-idp"></a>

Next, depending on your SAML\-based IdP, you may need to manually update your IdP to trust AWS as a service provider by uploading the `saml-metadata.xml` file at [https://signin\.aws\.amazon\.com/static/saml\-metadata\.xml](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/static/saml-metadata.xml) to your IdP\. This step updates your IdP’s metadata\. For some IdPs, the update may already be configured\. If this is the case, proceed to the next step\.

If this update is not already configured in your IdP, review the documentation provided by your IdP for information about how to update the metadata\. Some providers give you the option to type the URL, and the IdP obtains and installs the file for you\. Others require you to download the file from the URL and then provide it as a local file\.

## Step 5: Create Assertions for the SAML Authentication Response<a name="external-identity-providers-create-assertions"></a>

Next, depending on your SAML\-based IdP, you may need to configure the information that the IdP passes as SAML attributes to AWS as part of the authentication response\. For some IdPs, this information may already be configured\. If this is the case, proceed to the next step\. 

If this information is not already configured in your IdP, provide the following:
+ **SAML Subject NameID** – The unique identifier for the user who is signing in\. 
**Note**  
For stacks with domain\-joined fleets, the NameID value for the user must be provided in the format of "`domain\username`" using the sAMAccountName or "`username@domain.com`" using userPrincipalName\. If you are using the sAMAccountName format, you can specify the `domain` by using either the NetBIOS name or the fully qualified domain name \(FQDN\)\. For more information, see [Using Active Directory with AppStream 2\.0](active-directory.md)\.
+ **SAML Subject Type** \(with a value set to `persistent`\) – Setting the value to `persistent` ensures that your IdP sends the same unique value for the `NameID` element in all SAML requests from a particular user\. Make sure that your IAM policy includes a condition to only allow SAML requests with a SAML sub\_type set to `persistent`, as described in [Step 2: Create a SAML 2\.0 Federation IAM Role](#external-identity-providers-grantperms)\.
+ **`Attribute` element with the `Name` attribute set to https://aws\.amazon\.com/SAML/Attributes/Role** – This element contains one or more `AttributeValue` elements that list the IAM role and SAML IdP to which the user is mapped by your IdP\. The role and IdP are specified as a comma\-delimited pair of ARNs\.
+ **`Attribute` element with the `Name` attribute set to https://aws\.amazon\.com/SAML/Attributes/RoleSessionName** – This element contains one `AttributeValue` element that provides an identifier for the AWS temporary credentials that are issued for SSO\. The value in the `AttributeValue` element must be between 2 and 64 characters long, can contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and the following characters: \+ \(plus sign\), = \(equals sign\), , \(comma\), \. \(period\), @ \(at symbol\), and \- \(hyphen\)\. It cannot contain spaces\. The value is typically a user ID \(bobsmith\) or an email address \(bobsmith@example\.com\)\. It should not be a value that includes a space, such as a user's display name \(Bob Smith\)\.
+ **`Attribute` element with the `SessionDuration` attribute set to https://aws\.amazon\.com/SAML/Attributes/SessionDuration \(optional\)** – This element contains one `AttributeValue` element that specifies the maximum amount of time that a federated streaming session for a user can remain active before reauthentication is required\. The default value is 60 minutes\. For more information, see the *An optional Attribute element with the SessionDuration attribute set to https://aws\.amazon\.com/SAML/Attributes/SessionDuration* section in [Configuring SAML Assertions for the Authentication Response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml_assertions.html)\.
**Note**  
Although `SessionDuration` is an optional attribute, we recommend that you include it in the SAML response\. If you do not specify this attribute, the session duration is set to a default value of 60 minutes\.  
If your users access their streaming applications in AppStream 2\.0 by using the AppStream 2\.0 client, their sessions are disconnected after their session duration expires\. If your users access their streaming applications in AppStream 2\.0 by using a web browser, after the users' session duration expires and they refresh their browser page, their sessions are disconnected\.

For more information about how to configure these elements, see [Configuring SAML Assertions for the Authentication Response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml_assertions.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. For information about specific configuration requirements for your IdP, see the documentation for your IdP\.

## Step 6: Configure the Relay State of Your Federation<a name="external-identity-providers-relay-state"></a>

Finally, use your IdP to configure the relay state of your federation to point to the AppStream 2\.0 stack relay state URL\. After successful authentication by AWS, the user is directed to the AppStream 2\.0 stack portal, defined as the relay state in the SAML authentication response\.

The format of the relay state URL is as follows:

```
https://relay-state-region-endpoint?stack=stackname&accountId=aws-account-id-without-hyphens
```

Construct your relay state URL from your AWS account ID, stack name, and the relay state endpoint associated with the Region in which your stack is located\.

Optionally, you can specify the name of the application that you want to launch automatically\. To find the application name, select the image in the AppStream 2\.0 console, choose the **Applications** tab, and note the name that displays in the **Application Name** column\. Alternatively, if you haven't yet created the image, connect to the image builder where you installed the application, and open Image Assistant\. The names of applications display in the **Add Apps** tab\.

```
https://relay-state-region-endpoint?stack=stackname&accountId=aws-account-id-without-hyphens&app=application-name-to-launch
```

The following table lists the relay state endpoints for the Regions where AppStream 2\.0 is available\. If you want your users to stream using a FIPS\-compliant connection, you must use a FIPS\-compliant endpoint\. For more information about FIPS endpoints, see [Protecting Data in Transit with FIPS Endpoints](protecting-data-in-transit-FIPS-endpoints.md)\.
