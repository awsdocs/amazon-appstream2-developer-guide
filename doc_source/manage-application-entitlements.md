# Manage Application Entitlements<a name="manage-application-entitlements"></a>

Amazon AppStream 2\.0 can dynamically build the application catalog to display the AppStream 2\.0 applications that users are entitled to access\. Application entitlements can be assigned based on attributes using a third\-party SAML 2\.0 identity provider, or by using the AppStream 2\.0 Dynamic Application Framework\. The following sections describe how to manage application entitlements\.

**Note**  
Attribute\-based application entitlements using a third\-party SAML 2\.0 identity provider is recommended for most scenarios\. If you would like to use an existing Dynamic App Provider that manages application package delivery in addition to entitlement, so that applications do not need to be installed in an AppStream 2\.0 image, Dynamic Application Framework is recommended\. For more information, see [Additional Resources for Learning About Dynamic App Providers and the Dynamic Application Framework](additional-resources-dynamic-app-providers.md)\.
