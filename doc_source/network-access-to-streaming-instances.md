# Network Access to Your Streaming Instance<a name="network-access-to-streaming-instances"></a>

A security group acts as a stateful firewall that controls what traffic is allowed to reach your streaming instances\. When you launch an AppStream 2\.0 streaming instance, assign it to one or more security groups\. Then, add rules to each security group that control traffic for the instance\. You can modify the rules for a security group at any time\. The new rules are automatically applied to all instances to which the security group is assigned\. 

For more information, see [Security Groups in Amazon AppStream 2\.0](managing-network-security-groups.md)\.
