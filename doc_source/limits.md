# Amazon AppStream 2\.0 Service Limits<a name="limits"></a>

By default, AWS limits the resources that you can create and the number of users who can use the service\. To request a limit increase, use the [AppStream 2\.0 Limits form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-appstream2)\.

The following table lists the limits for each AppStream 2\.0 resource\. Where no default limit is listed for a specific [instance family](instance-types.md) or instance type, the limit is 0\.
