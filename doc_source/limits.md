# Amazon AppStream 2\.0 Service Quotas<a name="limits"></a>

AppStream 2\.0 provides different resources that you can use\. AppStream 2\.0 resources include stacks, fleets, images, and image builders\. When you create your Amazon Web Services account, we set default quotas \(also referred to as limits\) on the number of resources that you can create, and on the number of users who can use the AppStream 2\.0 service\.

To request a quota increase, you can use the Service Quotas console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/servicequotas/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/)\. For more information, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\.

The following table lists the default quotas for each AppStream 2\.0 resource and for users in the AppStream 2\.0 user pool\. The actual quotas for your account could be higher or lower, depending on when you created your account\.

\* AppStream 2\.0 instance type and size quotas are per AWS account per AWS Region\. If you have multiple fleets in the same Region that use the same instance type and size, the total number of instances in all fleets in that Region must be less than or equal to the applicable quota\. To determine which instance types are available in which Regions or Availability Zones, see *Pricing by AWS Region â€“ Always\-On, On\-Demand, and image builder instances* in [AppStream 2\.0 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/pricing/)\.

For fleets that have **Default Internet Access** enabled, the quota is 100 fleet instances\. If your deployment must support more than 100 concurrent users, use the [NAT gateway configuration](managing-network-internet-NAT-gateway.md) instead\. For more information about enabling internet access for a fleet, see [Internet Access](internet-access.md)\.
