# Amazon AppStream 2\.0 Service Quotas<a name="limits"></a>

AppStream 2\.0 provides different resources that you can use\. AppStream 2\.0 resources include stacks, fleets, images, and image builders\. When you create your AWS account, we set default quotas \(also referred to as limits\) on the number of resources that you can create, and on the number of users who can use the AppStream 2\.0 service\.

To request a quota increase, you can use the Service Quotas console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/servicequotas/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/)\. For more information, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\.

The following table lists the default quotas for each AppStream 2\.0 resource and for users in the AppStream 2\.0 user pool\. Where no default quota is listed for a specific [instance family](instance-types.md) or instance type, the quota is 0\. To determine which instance types are available in which Regions or Availability Zones, see *Pricing by AWS Region â€“ Always\-On, On\-Demand, and image builder instances* in [AppStream 2\.0 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/pricing/)\.


**Default Quotas Per AWS Region Per Account**  

| Resource | Default Quota | 
| --- | --- | 
| Stacks | 10 | 
| Fleets | 10 | 
| Fleet instances\* |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/limits.html)  | 
| Image builder instances  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/limits.html)  | 
| Image builders \(total\) | 10 | 
| Images | 10 | 
| Number of AWS accounts an image can be shared with | 100 | 
| Concurrent image copies | 2 per destination Region | 
| Image copies \(per month\) | 20 | 
| Users in the user pool | 50 | 

\*AppStream 2\.0 instance type and size quotas are per AWS account, per AWS Region\. If you have multiple fleets in the same Region that use the same instance type and size, the total number of instances in all fleets in that Region must be less than or equal to the applicable quota\.

For fleets that have **Default Internet Access** enabled, the quota is 100 fleet instances\. If your deployment must support more than 100 concurrent users, use the [NAT gateway configuration](managing-network-internet-NAT-gateway.md) instead\. For more information about enabling internet access for a fleet, see [Internet Access](internet-access.md)\.
