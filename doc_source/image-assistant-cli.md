# Image Assistant CLI Tool for Linux<a name="image-assistant-cli"></a>

On a Linux\-based image builder, you can use the Image Assistant CLI tool **AppStreamImageAssistant** to create and manage your AppStream 2\.0 image\. The tool is located at `/usr/local/appstream/image-assistant/AppStreamImageAssistant` with a symbolic link at `/bin/AppStreamImageAssistant`\. This CLI tool for Linux supports many of the same operations as the Image Assistant CLI tool for Windows\. For more information on these operations, see [Image Assistant CLI Operations for Creating and Managing Your AppStream 2\.0 Image](programmatically-create-image.md#cli-operations-managing-creating-image-image-assistant)\.
