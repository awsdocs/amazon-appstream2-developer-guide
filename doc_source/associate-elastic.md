# Associate Applications to Elastic Fleets<a name="associate-elastic"></a>

Applications must be associated to Elastic fleets before they appear to users in the application catalog to be launched\. You can manage application associations using the AppStream 2\.0 console\. For information about how to associate applications when creating an Elastic fleet, and how to manage application associations on existing fleets, see [Update an AppStream 2\.0 Fleet ](update-fleets-new-image.md)\.
