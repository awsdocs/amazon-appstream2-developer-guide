# Applications<a name="applications-elastic"></a>

Applications contain the details necessary to launch your application after the VHD has been mounted\. Applications also include the name and icon that are displayed to your user on the application catalog\. Applications are associated with the app block resource that contains the files and binaries for that application\.

You can use the AppStream 2\.0 console to create the application resource once you have uploaded your application icon to an Amazon S3 bucket and created the app block that contains the files and folders necessary to launch the application\. To learn more about uploading the application icon to an Amazon S3 bucket, see [Store Application Icon, Setup Script, Session Script, and VHD in S3 Bucket](store-s3-bucket.md)\.

**Note**  
You must have IAM permissions to perform the `S3:GetObject` action on the application icon object in the S3 bucket to create the application resource\.

**To create the application resource**

1. \(Optional\) For **Application working directory** in the **Application settings** section, enter the directory on the streaming instance to use for the application's working directory\.
